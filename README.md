# TAMU RED Avionics Subteam - Data Collection Repository

## About
This repository is dedicated to the Avionics Subteam of the Texas A&M University Rocket Engine Design Team (TAMU RED). Our mission is aligned with the overarching goals of TAMU RED: to provide students with an avenue to develop an intuitive understanding of liquid rocket propulsion and other vital systems involved in rocketry, through an iterative process of designing, manufacturing, and testing.

### Subteam Mission
The Avionics Subteam focuses on the collection, analysis, and storage of data from rocket tests. This includes but is not limited to sensor interfacing, data logging, and telemetry. Our work ensures that the data required for successful design iterations and safety protocols are accurately and reliably collected.
